# Dubai Airports Customer Happiness Tracking Dashboard

This repository showcases the dashboard design for a Facial Emotion Recognition System (FERS) that tracks customer happiness in Dubai Airports. The dashboard was created as a proposal for the Dubai Hackathon 2023. It provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and emotions by recognizing their facial expressions.

## Team Contribution

- The dashboard design was a collaborative effort of two team members, with a primary focus on the theme, layout, and graph creation.
- I was the main contributor responsible for the design and implementation of the dashboard's visual elements and graphical representations.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of two pages, each serving a unique purpose:

### Page 1: Customer Happiness Statistics

- The first page of the dashboard presents comprehensive customer happiness rate statistics, allowing Dubai Airports Staff to track and analyze customer satisfaction trends.
- Airport Staff can view traffic concentration of customers per area in the airport, providing insights into high-traffic zones.
- Time-based happiness rates for different areas are displayed through visually appealing graphical representations.
- A calendar feature allows users to check historical statistics for any previous day.
- Daily and monthly airport traffic can also be viewed, providing a holistic overview of customer influx.

### Page 2: Emotion Heatmap and Camera Statistics

- The second page features an emotion heatmap, visualizing customer emotions across different areas of the airport.
- The heatmap color codes areas based on customer emotions, with green indicating happiness and red representing anger or disappointment.
