# Dubai Airports Customer Happiness Tracking Dashboard

This repository showcases the dashboard design for a Facial Emotion Recognition System (FERS) that tracks customer happiness in Dubai Airports. The dashboard was created as a proposal for the Dubai Hackathon 2023. It provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and emotions by recognizing their facial expressions.

## Team Contribution

- The dashboard design was a collaborative effort of two team members, with a primary focus on the theme, layout, and graph creation.
